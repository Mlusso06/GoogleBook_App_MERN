### Prerequisites

What things you need: 
* code editing [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)

```
Open your Code editing software (example Visual Studio)

Open the "Terminal" in studio
perform a git clone  https://github.com/Mlusso06/GoogleBook_App_MERN.git
```

### Installing

After having the files cloned into your Studio, I would perform a 
* "Save Workspace AS" to have a workspace to come back to.
* Next you will need to install your code's Dependencies
    * This will capture all the items in your package.json file

See below on how to perform the install.

npm i
```
You will be installing the following npm packages on the server package side:
* axios
* react-router-dom
* mongoose
* dotenv (if you want to hide your info)
* express
* if-env
```
npm i 
```
This one is on the Client folder, Package.json
* react
* react-dom
* react-router-dom
* react-scripts

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

you should see the below when it starts
